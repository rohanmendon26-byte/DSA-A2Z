// Therefore, the overall time complexity is:

// O(mlogM)
// 	​

// Space Complexity

// The algorithm only uses a few variables (low, high, mid, stores).

// No extra arrays or data structures are created.

// O(1)

// Input: n = 6, quantities = [11,6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: One optimal way is:
// - The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3
// - The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3
// The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.


// Input: n = 7, quantities = [15,10,10]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: One optimal way is:
// - The 15 products of type 0 are distributed to the first three stores in these amounts: 5, 5, 5
// - The 10 products of type 1 are distributed to the next two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
// - The 10 products of type 2 are distributed to the last two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
// The maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5.


// Input: n = 1, quantities = [100000]
// Output: 100000
// Explanation: The only optimal way is:
// - The 100000 products of type 0 are distributed to the only store.
// The maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.
